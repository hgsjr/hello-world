# hello-world

Hello, people!

My name is Harley. I am from Brazil and I am initializing in the Computer Science field.
I hope I turn my self into a successful developer and maybe, someday, become the CEO of a well-known company created by myself.
Finally, I study at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil.
That's it. I am glad I can try to make world a better place by using the habilities Computer Science gives to us.
